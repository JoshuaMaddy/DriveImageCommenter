# Drive Image Commenter

This web application uses the Google Drive API to provide an alternative UI for commenting on images.

The comment feature on Google Drive does not allow for creating, reading, or editing comments while zoomed into an image, greatly hindering the experience. This application allows for zoomed in commenting.

A Google OAuth2 desktop credential.json with full drive access must be placed in .credentials, or the location specified in app_settings.py.
